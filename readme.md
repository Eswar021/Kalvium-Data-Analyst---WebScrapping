# Election Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing election data retrieved from the Election Commission of India's website. Using Python, we extracted, cleaned, and structured data from various types of elections including general elections to assembly constituencies, bye-elections, and parliamentary elections across different states.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Extract election data from web sources using Python.
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Analyze election results to identify winners, leading parties, margins of victory, and other insights.
- Visualize trends and patterns in election outcomes using charts and graphs.

## Insights

1. **State-wise Party Performance**
2. **Top Leading Candidates**
3. **Margin of Victory Analysis**
4. **Party with Highest Margins**
5. **Status Distribution**
6. **Vote Share Analysis (from Bye-Election Constituency-wise)**
7. **Party-wise Results Analysis**
8. **Leading Party Analysis in General Elections**
9. **Comparison of Leading and Trailing Candidates by State**
10. **Analysis of Margin Distribution in General Elections**
11. **Party-wise Vote Share Analysis in Bye Elections**
12. **Leading Candidate Analysis by Party in General Elections**
13. **Party-wise Seats Won Analysis**

Each insight provides detailed analysis and visual representations of election data, showcasing patterns and outcomes across different elections and parties.
